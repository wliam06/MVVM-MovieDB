# MVVM-MovieDB
Welcome to MVVM-MovieDB.

## Folder Structure
To organize groups, files and code into more specifically. I use this structure as below:
 - `Application` - contain based of `Application`.
 - `DI` - contains `Dependency Injection` as central units.
 - `Data` - contains `Repository` as coordinate data layer.
 - `Domain` - contains of `Entities`, `Use Cases`,  and `Interfaces`.
 - `Presentation` - contains of `View` and `ViewModel`.
